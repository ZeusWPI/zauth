Hi {{ name }}!

We've received a password reset request for your account.
If this was you, please visit the following URL to reset your password:
{{ reset_url }}

Please note that this reset link is only temporarily valid.

If this wasn't you, there is no need to panic (yet). You can safely ignore this
email because no harm has been done. Unless you receive a follow-up email
telling you your email has been reset. In that case you have a good reason to
panic because someone was able to snoop this email from you.

Kind regards
